Project status & release cycle
While there is always a lot to do and improve on, pretix by now has been in use for more than a dozen conferences that sold over ten thousand tickets combined without major problems. We therefore think of pretix as being stable and ready to use.

If you want to use or extend pretix, we strongly recommend to follow our blog. We will announce all releases there. You can always find the latest stable version on PyPI or in the release/X.Y branch of this repository. The master branch contains a development version that we also try to keep stable in the sense that it does not break your data, but its APIs might change without prior notice.

To get started using pretix on your own server, look at the installation guide in our documentation.

This project is 100 percent free and open source software. If you are interested in commercial support, hosting services or supporting this project financially, please go to pretix.eu or contact us at support@pretix.eu.
